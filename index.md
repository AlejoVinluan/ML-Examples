* Ability to work independently


I was able to understand Machine Learning through this portfolio. I know how to utilize it in both R and Python in order to be more effective in the workforce. I enjoy that we can do cool experiments using Machine Learning including the Image Classification of Doom and Animal Crossing. In order to keep up with the field, I'd like to do more Machine Learning projects and research other fields like self-driving vehicles.
