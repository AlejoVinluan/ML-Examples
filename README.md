# ML-Examples
A set of Machine Learning examples I created for CS 4375- Introduction to Machine Learning.

An [Overview of Machine Learning](Overview_of_ML.pdf) is available as a quick explanation of these Machine Learning examples.

## Program 1
A basic C++ program with functions to find the sum, mean, median, and range of a vector. There are also functions that find the covariance and correlations of two vectors.

To run with the sample data, use the following code in the directory:
> g++ -o main main.cpp

> main

Documentation can be found [here](/Program%201/Program%201%20Overview.pdf).
The code is provided [here](/Program%201/).

## Program 2
2 basic programs that explore Linear Regression. Classification and Regression models are used with basic Linear Regression models to predict certain outcomes.

The code is provided [here](/Program%202/).

## Program 3
This directory holds 2 files that implement Machine Learning algorithms from scratch. Logical Regression and the Naive Bayes Classification algorithms are both implemented from scratch in C++ so as to understand the inner workings of both algorithms. The files will print out the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of each algorithm. These algorithms utilize a dataset of Titanic passengers and attempts to predict whether or not each passenger survives utilizing their Ticket Class, Age, and Sex.

The code is provided [here](/Program%203/).


## Program 4
This R Notebook will explore Classification utilizing a loan dataset. The dataset will attempt to predict whether or not an applicant was approved or declined for the loan. The following notebook will utilize Logistic Regression, kNN, and Decision Trees as different models for prediction. Comparisons will be made after each model is utilized and an analysis about why each model produced their results. 

The notebook is provided [here](/Program%204/program4.rmd)


## Program 5
This Jupyter notebook will explore Classification utilizing an Automobile dataset. The dataset will attempt to predict what model a used vehicle is depending on the multiple factors including selling price, engine size, miles per gallon, and other factors. It will utilize Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks to make predictions.

The notebook is provided [here](/Program%205/sklearn.ipynb)


## Program 6
This Jupyter notebook explores image classification in Keras. It uses a sequential model to evaluate the test data. This is repeated with different architectures such as RNN and CNN for evaluation. Finally, a pretrained model is used for classification. The dataset utilized is Animal Crossing vs Doom. Doom and Animal Crossing are video games with different art styles in that Animal Crossing is a relaxing game where you design an island and Doom is a First Person Shooter where you slay hordes of demons. 

The notebook is provided [here](/Program%206/main.ipynb)
