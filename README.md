# ML-Examples
A set of Machine Learning examples I created for CS 4375- Introduction to Machine Learning.

An [Overview of Machine Learning](Overview_of_ML.pdf) is available as a quick explanation of these Machine Learning examples.

## Program 1
A basic C++ program with functions to find the sum, mean, median, and range of a vector. There are also functions that find the covariance and correlations of two vectors.

To run with the sample data, use the following code in the directory:
> g++ -o main main.cpp

> main

Documentation can be found [here](/Program%201/Program%201%20Overview.pdf).
The code is provided [here](/Program%201/).

## Program 2
2 basic programs that explore Linear Regression. Classification and Regression models are used with basic Linear Regression models to predict certain outcomes.

The code is provided [here](/Program%202/).

## Program 3
This directory holds 2 files that implement Machine Learning algorithms from scratch. Logical Regression and the Naive Bayes Classification algorithms are both implemented from scratch in C++ so as to understand the inner workings of both algorithms. The files will print out the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of each algorithm. These algorithms utilize a dataset of Titanic passengers and attempts to predict whether or not each passenger survives utilizing their Ticket Class, Age, and Sex.

The code is provided [here](/Program$203/).
