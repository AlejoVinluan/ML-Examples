# ML-Examples
A set of Machine Learning examples I created for CS 4375- Introduction to Machine Learning.

An [Overview of Machine Learning](Overview_of_ML.pdf) is available as a quick explanation of these Machine Learning examples.

## Program 1
A basic C++ program with functions to find the sum, mean, median, and range of a vector. There are also functions that find the covariance and correlations of two vectors.

To run with the sample data, use the following code in the directory:
> g++ -o main main.cpp

> main

Documentation can be found [here](/Program%201/Program%201%20Overview.pdf).
The code is provided [here](/Program%201/).

## Program 2
2 basic programs that explore Linear Regression. Classification and Regression models are used with basic Linear Regression models to predict certain outcomes.

The code is provided [here](/Program%202/).
